üíß FaucetDrops
FaucetDrops is a lightweight, user-friendly platform for crypto and blockchain communities to distribute ETH, ERC20 tokens, or stablecoins seamlessly. Built for events, hackathons, DAOs, and testnet incentives, it automates token drops with sybil-resistance, privacy, and cross-chain support. Prevent bot abuse, ensure fair distribution, and track everything in real-time.
Powered by Self Protocol for ZK-powered identity verification, FaucetDrops makes onboarding faster and more secure‚Äîverify users in under a minute without compromising privacy.

üåü Why FaucetDrops?
Manual token distribution is slow, error-prone, and vulnerable to bots. FaucetDrops fixes this with automated, verifiable drops. Key benefits:

Gasless & Fast: Users claim tokens instantly without fees.
Sybil-Resistant: Integrates ZK proof-of-humanity to ensure real users (no bots gaming the system).
Customizable Types: Choose DropCode (code-based), DropList (whitelisted), or Custom (individual amounts).
Social Verification: Require tasks like following on Twitter or joining Telegram before claims.
Multi-Admin: Collaborate with team members to manage faucets.
Cross-Chain: Supports Celo, Lisk, Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism.
Traceable & Secure: View transaction history, reset claims, and withdraw unclaimed funds.
Developer-Friendly: Factory + Instance pattern for scalable smart contracts.

Ideal for community managers, DeFi projects, DAOs, hackathon organizers, and testnet coordinators.

üß© How It Works

Create a Faucet: Choose type (DropCode, DropList, Custom), set token/ETH, amount, whitelist, and time windows.
Fund & Configure: Deposit tokens, add social tasks for verification, and manage admins.
Share & Claim: Users verify tasks, enter codes (if required), and claim via connected wallet.
Track & Manage: Monitor history, reset claims, edit names, or delete inactive faucets.

Backend: Node.js for off-chain tasks (e.g., code generation, social verification).

Example Workflow:

Deploy faucet via Factory.
Configure type, fund, set tasks/parameters.
Users verify, claim during window.
Admins track/withdraw/reset.


üîí Security & Protections

ZK Verification: Privacy-preserving human checks via Self Protocol.
Code/Whitelist: Restrict claims to authorized users.
Admin Safeguards: Owner/factory owner can't be removed; multi-admin optional.
